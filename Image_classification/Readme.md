Dear Readers,

Welcome to this comprehensive guide designed to assist you in utilizing object detection across various fields. In this guide, we will delve into the exploration of identifying objects within images to facilitate processing and subsequent action.

The potential applications of object detection are vast, ranging from serving as a fundamental component in the automation of self-driving cars to enabling actions triggered by signals, road signs, and traffic level detection.

To achieve our objectives, we employ Microsoft Fabric Data Engineering in conjunction with Azure Image Detection, both integral components of Azure Cognitive Services.

Outlined below are the steps to effectively utilize object detection:

Step 1: Installation and importing of necessary libraries.
