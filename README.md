 Our solution combines Microsoft Fabric Notebook, Copilot, and OpenAI to revolutionize document analysis. Fabric Notebook provides a versatile coding environment, Copilot ensures scalability, and OpenAI's LLM models interpret documents, extract insights, generate summaries, and enable Q&A interactions. This integration automates time-consuming tasks, streamlines decision-making, and offers innovative applications in knowledge management, delivering efficient and accurate document interpretation for enterprises grappling with vast textual data.

2.**Real-time analytics: Stocks Analyzer and BI reporting**

 Employing Microsoft Fabric and Synapse Data Engineering Notebook, we execute real-time analytics by fetching and scraping streaming API stocks data through a meticulously scheduled data pipeline. Subsequently, we load this data into delta tables, establishing semantic links via lakehouse architecture for real-time stock data reporting. Leveraging Power BI, our reports, directly linked to the data lake, auto-refresh, furnishing custom stock analyses seamlessly, ensuring timely and informed decision-making.


3.**Automation Driving using  Image classification**

Utilizing Microsoft Fabric, a sophisticated image detection model is crafted using PySpark Python. This model harnesses the Azure AI service "Cognitive Services Image Detection" to identify objects and categorize them based on predefined parameters. Furthermore, seamless integration with Onelake Fabric lakehouse enables efficient storage of processed images. Such a model holds immense potential for implementation in Automation Driving, enhancing safety and efficiency through advanced image recognition capabilities.
